## Realisation
### II. FEBRUARY
* Have an idea
* Have a name for your idea 
* Have a plan for your idea - have it electronically
##### User Story - user side information about what something does that can fit on a info card/postit note (15-20 words)
* Having 20-30-40 user stories is ideal (user stories have nothing to do with who is making them)
* 500 is good, if you have the motivation
* _Give each Story time it would take to implement_ - more than 1 - 16, 10 is the best, if less - just make the thing, if more - seperate it into part
* When adding all the times, you get a number (e.g 1000), plan work per person per week (e.g _20, but it is best to be less than that_) and see how many weeks it will take (e.g 25)
* Planning is useful, but it won't look great at first
* With time, planning gets better, if you do it enough
* Know yourself and your partner
* Role-play a business - money managment, time managment, thinking about the konkurencia
* _Prioritize_ - 1 has the least amount of tasks, 2 has the most amount of tasks, 3 is extra stuff you won't have time for but would still be good to implemtent in the future so should be taken into consideration when doing the tasks in 1 and 2
* Split the work, just don't think that if you have 6 1 tasks, each of you has to do 3 

### III. MARCH

### IV. APRIL

### V. MAY
* Wiki of the project 
* GitHub history
* VIDEO - trying to sell the project...
## General tips
* Never only do one thing (so like backend, user inteface, design and so on should be done at the same time, little by little)
* Sell your idea and lie about it if you can to get people pumped, get money, and then do it aka the Patreon model of business
* Relax, Mitov will help (it can be embeded, this is where I die)
